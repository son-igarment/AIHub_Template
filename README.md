# AIHub Template

AIHub Template is a customized WordPress starter theme maintained by Phạm Lê Ngọc Sơn. The theme uses a new deep blue and coral palette and ships without bundled images so you can start from a clean slate.

## Palette
- Accent: `#d64045`
- Headings: `#0c1424`
- Main/base: `#15233b`
- Paragraph: `#3f4a5a`
- Surface: `#f7f8fb`

## What changed
- Removed bundled image assets and logo usage; branding now renders as text.
- Updated navigation toggles and form controls to avoid image-based icons.
- Updated ownership metadata and bumped the theme to version `1.0.0` under the MIT License.

## Development
- Prebuilt assets live under `css/` and `js/`.
- To rebuild: install dependencies with `npm install` and run your preferred gulp/webpack tasks from the project root.
